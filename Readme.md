# Graphs and network analysis in Spotify
This project aims to explore different features of different artists in spotify, computing some relevant information about them and creating 
some graphs starting from a given artist.


## Structure of the repositori

For each session we have create a folder which contains the report, the skeleton.py along with a .ipynb file also with the code of that session and the data generated in that session. We have decided to put a .ipynb file for each session as we consider that is more easy to run the code in cells.

In the Session_4 you will find the Gephi folder, you can find the documents used to generate the visualization of the asked graphs, gB and gD.
