## Structure of the repositori

For each session we have create a folder.
Each folder Contains:
1. The pdf report
2. the skeleton.py 
3. An .ipynb file also with the code of that session
4. The data generated in that session.

We have decided to put a .ipynb file for each session as we consider that is more easy to run the code in cells.
  
  
The Report.ipynb contains all the code used to generate the response in all the reports
  
Also in the Session_4 you will find the Gephi folder there you can find the documents used to generate the visualization of the asked graphs, gB and gD.
